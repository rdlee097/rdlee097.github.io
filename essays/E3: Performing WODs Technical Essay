The WOD involved creating an index about the history of web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome. Integrating the reference link to words in the paragraph tag was a rewarding experience to see the links direct the user to another site. Some difficulties I went through while working on the WODs was correlating the hyperlink from the image link to each browser name. The first attempt of each BrowserHistory involved doing steps that I was able to work on while referencing the walkthrough videos for areas I had been stuck on. After the attempts of working through the WODs, after learning how to look up script to understand how to prepare functions or data in a tag to set an image or setting a reference helped to understand how each tag or script affects each step. Something I will do differently to prepare better for a task in the next WOD would be learning more terminology.
