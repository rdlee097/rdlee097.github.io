  Hello, I am Daniel Lee, I am majoring in Finance with an interest in MIS and am a Junior in UHM. As a transfer student from KCC after finishing a culinary arts degree I have decided to take on a further education into the world of business. My interest in business began from a background of family restaurants and seeing the growth of hard work inspired me to pursue my future aspirations. I entered Shidler in Fall of 2019 and have been expanding my soft skills and practicing along the way. The future is in technology as we have seen the evolution from start up to smartphones and AI and it's continuous progression. With an interest in both busniess and new technology, MIS looks to be the best middle ground of both worlds.
