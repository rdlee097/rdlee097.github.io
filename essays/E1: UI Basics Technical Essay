The WODs took a long time to follow through during my first attempt to try doing the assignments to the best of my knowledge in the first browserhistory. Partway through the first browserhistory I had to continue watching the screencast solutions since the tasks went beyond my ability to continue the steps, after watchingthe screencast and following along the first time I was able to complete the BrowserHistory1 in 27 minutes. My third attempt led me to completing the first assignment in 21 minutes with time to spare.  Continuing into BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3 was a continuously daunting time as I initially had to follow the screencasts to understand how to create a new boundry or text alignment. After completing the screencast I was able to make both attempts before the 20 minute mark and complete the WODs. Having to go back and check when you may have missed a step or line of code can be mind boggling but rewarding when you figure it out without having to look back at the screencast to save you.
