My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
After following along in the lab assignments and completing the first project(Assignment 1), I have learned a lot through the basics of programming in JavaScript. By going through this process, I have had to learn how to problem solve on my own. Being able pinpoint a problem and find solutions though experience and research is needed to grow this skillset.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:
Due to what I believe is the method to improve my own programming skills, I think it will be important to first dive deeper into w3schools to understand different ways to process functions and translating that into our html projects to come. By continuing to follow screencasts as a guide and doing my own research I believe my own programming skills will prosper to create new projects once this course is over.

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.
I try to follow along on WODs on my own before looking at screencasts to see how much I have been able to retain from class. Usually I will look towards the screencasts once I have taken a break from a issue and am still unable to move past the problem. 

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
The labs are a learning process while going though examples to help me finish assignments. They give me confidence to reference back upon to see basic examples and how to gradually add more code to create a better product and understanding for myself. The labs along with the screencasts are a great tool that I think will be useful in future projects.

I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).
I think there are still concepts that I will need to work on so I can reference them in a smoother manner in the future. Instead of having to constantly reference w3school, past labs, and screencasts for the next stage in programming and assignments. 

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:
The amount of content the class is well to what I believe is helpful in progressing my learning skills. If anything, being able to follow along with Laulima in terms of when assignments are to be turned in. I understand that the ITM dynamic schedule is the primary source of when assignments are due but Laulima is personally easier for me to follow up with. As emails are sent out as reminders when a lab or assignment is due.

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:
The screencasts have been the most helpful learning tool for our class assignments and reference incase there was something I overlooked previously. Also being able to have contact will the professor and student graders is a helpful thing when asking for help.
